# Parsing borsh messages with ZST which are not-copy/clone is unsound

Affected versions of borsh cause undefined behaviour when zero-sized-types (ZST) are parsed and the Copy/Clone traits are not implemented/derived.
For instance if 1000 instances of a ZST are deserialized, and the ZST is not copy (this can be achieved through a a singleton), 
then accessing/writing to deserialized data will cause a segmentation faul.
