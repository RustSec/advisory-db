# Unsound creation of `Vec` from misaligned pointer
In the function `visit`, the pointer to `u8` was allowed to cast to the pointer of any types implementing the trait `PodVecView`. However, the trait can't stop the misalignment issues from happening. The internal usage of library tried to cast the `u8` pointer to `f32` pointer which could lead to undefined behavior.

The code has been patched and waited for release in latest version.
