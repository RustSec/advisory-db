# Transaction validity oversight in pallet-ethereum 

A bug in pallet-ethereum can cause invalid transactions to be included in the Ethereum block state in pallet-ethereum due to not validating the input data size. Any invalid transactions included this way have no possibility to alter the internal Ethereum or Substrate state. The transaction will appear to have be included, but is of no effect as it is rejected by the EVM engine. The impact is further limited by Substrate extrinsic size constraints.
