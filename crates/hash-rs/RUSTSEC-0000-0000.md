# Unsound implementation to misaligned pointer dereference
Three affected functions `sha1::from`, `sha3::from`, and `sha3::xor_with` all casted the type aligned to 1 byte to larger aligned type, and deref the misaligned pointers to return them. Misaligned pointer dereference would lead to undefined behavior.
