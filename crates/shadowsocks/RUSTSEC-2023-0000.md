# `shadowsocks` misaligned reads.
The current release of `shadowsocks` (`1.15.3` as of writing) has a bug that causes a segmentation
fault due to a misaligned read when reading a SOCKS header.

I do not know when this behavior was introduced. The code itself used to work just fine with older
stable Rust compilers (`.1.68`), but recent stable versions have exposed the misaligned reads,
possibly due to more aggressive use of SIMD instructions. The crux of the issue is attempting to read
16 bit values at uneven offsets from a unsigned byte slice. This behavior has been verified in
aarch64 on macOS and x86_64 on Linux, but I see no reason it wouldn't fail on Windows too.

The offending code itself is all found in `shadowsocks::relay::socks5::Address::read_from`, as can
be seen [on GitHub]. The bug can be verified by just running a `cargo test -p shadowsocks --test
tcp` with the `v1.15.3` [release].

Currently, the bug is already fixed in the main branch (`32de79eeb7f3b0867ee415b16f5ead0df8a750ef`
at time of writing) in [commit] (`c2877c10b589f8123840741c6ce1d553b33892ae`), but it has not been
backported on top of the latest released crate.
