# Broken validity invariants in safe functions
The safe functions `from_float` and `from_tag` allow `f64` to transmute to arbitrary types which could be specified in `TaggedHandle`. The values of `f64` can be illegal for other types such as `bool`. It can break the validity invariants of types in the program.
