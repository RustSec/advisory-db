# Integer overflow in brotli2

A buffer overflow exists in the Brotli library versions prior to 1.0.8 where an attacker controlling the input length of a "one-shot" decompression request to a script can trigger a crash, which happens when copying over chunks of data larger than 2 GiB.

It is recommended to update your Brotli library to 1.0.8 or later. 

If one cannot update, we recommend to use the "streaming" API as opposed to the "one-shot" API, and impose chunk size limits.
