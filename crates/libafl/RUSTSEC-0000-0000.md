# Create slice from misaligned pointer

In the safe function `post_exec`, the u8 raw pointer was cast to u16 pointer and passed to `core::slice::from_raw_parts_mut` which requires the pointer to be aligned. The unsound implementation could lead to undefined behavior.

Note: The issue has been approved and fixed by authors. The patched version could be released after the pull request got reviewed.
