# No default limit put on request bodies

`<bytes::Bytes as axum_core::extract::FromRequest>::from_request` would not, by
default, set a limit for the size of the request body. That meant if a malicious
peer would send a very large (or infinite) body your server might run out of
memory and crash.

This also applies to these extractors which used `Bytes::from_request`
internally:
- `axum::extract::Form`
- `axum::extract::Json`
- `String`

axum `>= 0.5.16` and `>= 0.6.0.rc.2` also has the patch. axum `0.6.0.rc.1` is
vulnerable.

The patched versions will set a 2 MB limit by default.
