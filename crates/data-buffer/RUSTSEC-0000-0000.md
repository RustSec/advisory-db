# Allows uninitialized memory exposure in safe function
The safe function `push` allows users to cast arbitrary types as bytes. If user provides a `struct` type with padding bytes, it could violate the safety guarantee of `func` and expose the uninitialized memory.

Note: The crate is not maintained anymore.
