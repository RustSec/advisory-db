# `WavReader` and `WavWriter` write to uninitialized memory

Affected versions wrote to uninitialized memory that was created through
`Vec::with_capacity` followed by `Vec::set_len`. Hound did not read from nor
expose this uninitialized memory, but this construct is unsound nonetheless.
There is no evidence that the unsoundness has any security impact.

The unsoundness was addressed by using a small zero-initialized buffer (in the
case of `WavReader`), and through `mem::MaybeUninit` (for `WavWriter`).
