# Unsound implementation in several functions
In function `transmute_buf`, it casted an immutable pointer to mutable pointer leading to undefined behavior. In functions `value_u32_list`, `next_item`, `read_property`, `get_header`, `get_reserved_mem`, they all created misaligned pointer by casting and deref the resulted pointers.
