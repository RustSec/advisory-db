# Allows uninitialized memory exposure in safe function
The safe function `memory::any_as_bytes` and `memory::any_slice_as_bytes` both allow users to cast arbitrary types as bytes. If user provides a `struct` type with padding bytes, it could violate the safety guarantee of `func` and expose the uninitialized memory.

Note: Even though the author of the crate claimed that "this project does not follow typical guidance for the usage of unsafe". Based on the violation of office rust safety, we still send the report as a warning.
