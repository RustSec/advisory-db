# Segmentation fault due to access of uninitialized memory
Function "grcov::covdir::get_coverage" uses the unsafe keyword to call get_unchecked_mut, 
which accesses memory without performing bounds checking. 
This violates Rustâ€™s memory safety rules, as it can lead to invalid memory access if line_num is zero (0), 
potentially causing a segmentation fault (SEGV) at an unknown address
