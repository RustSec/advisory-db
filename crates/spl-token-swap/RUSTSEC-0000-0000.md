# Multiple unsoundness issues in public function `instruction::unpack`
The safe function `instruction::unpack` is unsound and accessible to users.  

The safe function allows misaligned pointer dereference:
```rs
use spl_token_swap::instruction::unpack;

fn main() {
    let a: [u8; 3] = [3; 3];
    let up = unpack::<u16>(&a).unwrap();
    println!("{}", up);
}
```
which will lead to panic.

The function also allows breaking validity invariant, e.g.,
```rs
fn main() {
    let a: [u8; 3] = [3; 3];
    let up = unpack::<bool>(&a).unwrap();
    println!("{}", up);
}
```
Miri will show that the value of boolean is invalid here.
