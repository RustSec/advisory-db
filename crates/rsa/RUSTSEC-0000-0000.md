# Marvin Attack: potential key recovery through timing sidechannels

The [Marvin Attack] is a timing sidechannel vulnerability which allows
performing RSA decryption and signing operations as an attacker with the
ability to observe only the time of the decryption operation performed with
the private key.

A recent survey of RSA implementations found that the Rust `rsa` crate is one
of many implementations vulnerable to this attack.

No fixed version is available at this time.
