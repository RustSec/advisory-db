# Unsound implementation of `MemoryRange::as_slice` and `as_slice_mut`
The implementation of functions cast the pointer of any bit patterns to arbitrary types, which can break the validity invariants for types. The functions should be declared as unsafe so that users should take care of the values when they create the pointer. At this timeline, authors of the package has submitted the PR for `unsafe` declaration and still under review.
