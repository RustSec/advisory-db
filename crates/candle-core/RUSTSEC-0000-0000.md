# Unsound usages of `std::slice::from_raw_parts` 

The library breaks the safety assumptions about alignment when using unsafe API `std::slice::from_raw_parts`. If the caller of the `qtensor_from_ggml` assigns the `GgmlDType` that is inconsistent with the ones expected from the `qtensor` stored in the ggml, the misalignment will occur and potentially lead to out-of-bound or incorrect `qtensor` issues.  

From the real-world perspective, it might be difficult for attacker to exploit this unsoundness bug since `qtensor_from_ggml` is used by model users themselves. The bug can only be triggered when users assign incorrect `GgmlDType`. Therefore, this could only be a unsound issue.  

To better prevent undefined behavior, we still suggest to fix the unsoundness here.
