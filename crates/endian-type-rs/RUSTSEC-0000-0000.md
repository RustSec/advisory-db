# Unsound implementation in `from_bytes`
The safe function allows `u8` byte slice to cast to arbitrary types. If the arbitrary type is the type aligned to larger bytes such as `u16`, it could create a misaligned pointer and dereference in the function. If the arbitrary type is `bool` which only allows 0/1 as bit patterns, then the function can create an invalid type and leads to undefined behavior
