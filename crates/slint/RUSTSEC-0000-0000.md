# Unsound transmute in slint_interpreter_value_to_struct

The function uses `transmute` to do reference type conversion. The Src type is the reference of the `repr(Rust)` struct, and the Dst type is the reference of the `repr(C)` struct. The crate only adds the assertion for size, but didn't check whether the Src type and Dst type are properly aligned. 

The related fix is attempted in commit [#690dbd7](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/commit/690dbd723b09dce59539f357f9c14fe57103ec44). However, asserting whether the Src type's alignment is the multiple of Dst type's alignment would be more precise.
