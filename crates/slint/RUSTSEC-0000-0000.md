# Unsound transmute on reference

The function uses `transmute` to do reference type conversion. The affected methods include `as_model_notify` for `ModelNotifyOpaque`, `as_struct(_mut)` for `StructOpaque`. The crate only adds the assertion for size, but didn't check whether the Src type and Dst type are properly aligned. 

The related fix is attempted in commit [#690dbd7](https://github.com/slint-ui/slint/commit/690dbd723b09dce59539f357f9c14fe57103ec44). However, asserting whether the Src type's alignment is the multiple of Dst type's alignment might be more precise.
