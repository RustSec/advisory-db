# clipboard is unmaintained

The last release was almost 4 years ago and the repository is effectively abandoned, with many outstanding issues
and pull requests that have no activity. Due to this, there is a very low chance any security issues would be
fixed.

Additionally, the sole maintainer of the repository has not been very active in general, which has
the chance of presenting heightened supply chain risk.
