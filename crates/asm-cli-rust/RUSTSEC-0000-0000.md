# Panic due to parsing empty string

When trying to parse empty string through asm-cli-rust, asm-cli-rust may pancic, 
possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when the string to be 
parsed is empty, because the function "X86AsmParser::MatchAndEmitATTInstruction"
tries to dereference the value of index 0 in that string although the string is empty
and panics as a result.

The flaw was corrected in commits 'eeb61d7' by using if statement to return Error code
when the given input is empty string instead of parsing the string directly.
