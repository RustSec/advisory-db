# Ascii allows out-of-bounds array indexing in safe code

Affected version of this crate had implementation of `From<&mut AsciiStr>` for `&mut [u8]` and `&mut str`. This can result in out-of-bounds array indexing in safe code.

The flaw was corrected in commit [8a6c779](https://github.com/tomprogrammer/rust-ascii/pull/63/commits/8a6c7798c202766bd57d70fb8d12739dd68fb9dc) by removing those impls.
