# Uninitialized memory exposure in several safe functions
The safe functions `DataBuffer::extend`, `DataBuffer::extend_from_slice`, and `video::assets::mesh::IndexFormat::encode` all allow users to cast arbitrary types as bytes. If user provides a `struct` type with padding bytes, it could violate the safety guarantee and expose the uninitialized memory.
