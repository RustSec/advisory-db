# Unsound layout assumption of `volatile_register::RW` 

The wrapper struct `volatile_register::RW` didn't have stable layout, and rustc would preserve the right to insert padding or reorder the structure. It should be declared as transparent; otherwise, casting it to u32 could lead to UB such as uninitialized memory exposure and break the safety guarantees of `ptr::read_volatile`.  

This was patched by changing dependency version of `volatile_register::RW`, which was defined as `#[repr(transparent)]` in version of `0.2.2`.
