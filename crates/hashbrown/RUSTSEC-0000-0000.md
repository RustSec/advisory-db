# Unsound usage of unsafe `transmute` implementation from `usize` to `T`

Unsafe misaligned conversion found at function `invalid_mut`. The pointer to 'usize' is converted to a struct `T`. This unsound implementation would create a misalignment issues if the type size of `usize` is smaller than the type size of struct `T`.
If we further manipulate the problematic converted types, it would potentially lead to different undefined behavior such as access out-of-bound.
