# Stack buffer overflow with whoami on illumos

With older versions of the whoami crate, calling the `username` function leads to an immediate stack
buffer overflow on illumos. Denial of service and data corruption have both been observed in the
wild, and the issue is possibly exploitable as well.

This also affects any other Unix platforms that aren't any of: `linux`, `macos`, `freebsd`,
`dragonfly`, `bitrig`, `openbsd`, `netbsd`.

This issue has been addressed in whoami 1.5.0.
