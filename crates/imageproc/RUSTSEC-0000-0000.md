# Integer Overflow Occurs in imageproc::contrast::adaptive_threshold.

The vulnerability in this library stems from the improper handling of certain values when parsing a PNG image, particularly within the function adaptive_threshold(). This function may miscalculate an integer, leading to an integer overflow. If an attacker crafts a PNG with specific metadata that triggers an overflow in the width and height calculations, the library could be compromised
