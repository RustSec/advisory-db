# Incorrect check for string equality

Affected versions of this crate did not properly check for string equality allowing substrings of a string to be considered equal.

This can be used to bypass protection mechanisms.

The flaw was corrected in commit [c14856b](https://github.com/seanmonstar/unicase/commit/c14856b0ef9b2e6d8dce802d1a9d5b83a7ce2118) by modifying the code to use a manual implementation of `Iterator::eq` rather than `Iterator::all`.
