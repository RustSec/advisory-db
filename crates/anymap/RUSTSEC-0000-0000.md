# Unsound usage of unsafe implementation from `Any` to `T`

Unsafe misaligned conversion found at function `downcast_ref_unchecked`, `downcast_mut_unchecked`, `downcast_unchecked`. The pointer to 'Any' is converted to a `T`. This unsound implementation would create a misalignment issues if the type size of `Any` is smaller than the type size of `T`.
If we further manipulate the problematic converted types, it would potentially lead to different undefined behavior such as access out-of-bound.

In the meantime, anymap may not be maintained.
