# Panic due to inappropriate string

When trying to parse untrusted string through kalker, kalker may pancic, 
possibly enabling a Denial of Service attack. This happens when the string to be 
parsed is "777_77" which make the value "radix" as too high(77), because the function "core::char::methods::to_digit"
gets assert! when the value "radix" is bigger than 36

The flaw was corrected in commits 'bcc0f94' by using if statement to return Error code
when the given input makes too high "radix" value instead of parsing the string directly.
