# sccache vulnerable to privilege escalation if server is run as root 

On Linux the `sccache` client can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of a local `sccache` server, by preloading the code in a shared library passed to `LD_PRELOAD`.

If the server is run as root (which is the default when installing the [snap package](https://snapcraft.io/sccache)), this means a user running
the `sccache` client can get root privileges.
