# sshkeys does not verify certificate signature

sshkeys will parse an SSH certificate into its fields without verifying the signature on the
certificate.  This can lead developers to think the certificate is valid and decide to trust
it for authentication or authorization purposes.  However, it would be trivial to present a
complete bogus certificate with a fake signature and get authenticated by such a system.  It
is advisable to not use this crate until signature verification is added.
