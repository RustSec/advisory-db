# Unsound usage of unsafe implementation from `Vec<u8>` to `T`

Unsafe misaligned conversion found at function `null_or_mut_ptr`. The pointer to 'Vec<u8>' is converted to a struct `T`. This unsound implementation would create a misalignment issues if the type size of `Vec<u8>` is smaller than the type size of struct `T`.
If we further manipulate the problematic converted types, it would potentially lead to different undefined behavior such as access out-of-bound.

In the meantime, bcc will no longer be maintained. Users are encouraged to migrate to libbpf-rs.
