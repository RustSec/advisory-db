# Unsound implementation lead to misaligned pointer dereference
There are several functions having unsound implementation which can lead to misaligned pointer dereference. Among these functions, One (`ring_elem`) allows casting `u8` pointer to arbitrary type and dereference it, and other are implementing concrete type casting and lead to same issues.

PoC can be found in link.
