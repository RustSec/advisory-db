# Calls to XmpFile::close can abort process if C++ XMP Toolkit throws an exception

Affected versions of the crate failed to catch C++ exceptions raised by the `XmpFile::close` function. Such an exception would trigger a process abort.

This is best demonstrated in [issue #230](https://github.com/adobe/xmp-toolkit-rs/issues/230), where a race condition caused the `close` call to fail due to file I/O errors.

This was fixed in [PR #232](https://github.com/adobe/xmp-toolkit-rs/pull/232) (released as crate version 1.9.0), which now safely handles the exception.

For backward compatibility, the existing API ignores the error. A new API `XmpFile::try_close` was added to allow callers to receive and process the error result.

Users of all prior versions of `xmp_toolkit` are encouraged to update to version 1.9.0 to avoid possible process aborts.
