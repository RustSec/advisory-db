# Race Condition Enabling Link Following and Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) Race Condition

The remove_dir_all crate is a Rust library that offers additional features over the Rust
standard library fs::remove_dir_all function. It suffers the same class of failure as the
code it was layering over: TOCTOU race conditions, with the ability to cause arbitrary
paths to be deleted by substituting a symlink for a path after the type of the path was checked.

Thanks to the Rust security team for identifying the problem and alerting us to it.
