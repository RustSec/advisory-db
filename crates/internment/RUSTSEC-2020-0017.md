# Use after free in ArcIntern::drop

`ArcIntern::drop` has a race condition where it can release memory
which is about to get another user. The new user will get a reference
to freed memory.

This was fixed by serializing access to an interned object while it
is being deallocated.

Versions prior to 0.3.12 used stronger locking which avoided the problem.
