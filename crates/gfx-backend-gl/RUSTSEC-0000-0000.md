# Unsound creation of slice from misaligned pointer
In the function `get`, the pointer to `u8` was allowed to cast to arbitrary types including `f32/f64/i32` which could create a misaligned pointer. When users pass the pointer to `slice::from_raw_parts`, users should guarantee that the pointer is aligned by themselves; otherwise, it could lead to undefined behavior.
