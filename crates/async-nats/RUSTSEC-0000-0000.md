# rustls integration vulnerable to MitM

The NATS Rust clients are vulnerable to MitM when using TLS.

The common name of the TLS certificate presented by the server is validated against the hostname provided by the NATS server INFO command during the initial connection setup phase.
Because the INFO parameters are sent as plaintext, a MitM proxy can replace the value of the host field to the common name of a valid certificate it controls, fooling the client into accepting it.

## Reproduction

1. The NATS Rust client tries to establish a new connection
2. The connection is intercepted by a MitM proxy
3. The proxy makes a separate connection to the NATS server
4. The NATS server replies with an INFO command
5. The proxy intercepts the INFO command, alters the host JSON field of it and passes the altered INFO back to the client
6. The proxy upgrades the client connection to TLS, presenting a certificate issued by a certificate authority present in the client's keychain. In the previous step the host field was set to the common name of said certificate.
7. This step can be found in my POC inside src/bin/mitm.rs line 102
8. The TLS library accepts the certificate, having verified that the common name matches the malicious value given to it
9. Although the connection is technically using TLS, the proxy is still able to see all of the traffic going between the client and the NATS server because we fooled it into accepting our certificate.
