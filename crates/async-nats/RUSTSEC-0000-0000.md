# TLS certificate common name validation bypass

The NATS official Rust clients are vulnerable to MitM when using TLS.

The common name of the TLS certificate presented by the server is validated against the
`host`name provided by the NATS server `INFO` message during the initial connection setup phase.
Because the `INFO` parameters are sent as plaintext, a MitM proxy can replace the value of
the `host` field to the common name of a valid certificate it controls, fooling the client into
accepting it.

## Reproduction steps

1. The NATS Rust client tries to establish a new connection
2. The connection is intercepted by a MitM proxy
3. The proxy makes a separate connection to the NATS server
4. The NATS server replies with an `INFO` message
5. The proxy reads the `INFO`, alters the `host` JSON field of it and passes
   the altered `INFO` back to the client
6. The proxy upgrades the client connection to TLS, presenting a certificate issued
   by a certificate authority present in the client's keychain.
   In the previous step the `host` was set to the common name of said certificate
7. `rustls` accepts the certificate, having verified that the common name matches the
   attacker-controlled value given to it
9. The client has been fooled into accepting the attacker's certificate
