# ReadTicket and WriteTicket should only be sendable when T is Send

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented `Send` for `ReadTicket<T>` & `WriteTicket<T>`.
This allows to send non-Send `T` to other threads.

This can allows creating data races by cloning types with internal mutability and sending them to other threads (as `T` of `ReadTicket<T>`/`WriteTicket<T>`). Such data races can cause memory corruption or other undefined behavior.

The flaw was corrected in commit a986a93 by adding `T: Send` bounds to `Send` impls of `ReadTicket<T>`/`WriteTicket<T>`.
