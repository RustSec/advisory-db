# op_panic in the base runtime can force a panic in the runtime's containing thread

Affected versions use deno_core releases that expose `Deno.core.ops.op_panic` to the JS runtime in the base core

This function when called triggers a manual panic in the thread containing the runtime.

It can be fixed by stubbing out the exposed op:
```javascript
Deno.core.ops.op_panic = (msg) => { throw new Error(msg) };
```
