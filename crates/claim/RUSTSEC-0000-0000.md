# `claim` is Unmaintained

The maintainer has been unresponsive regarding this crate for over a year. An issue with `claim`'s dependencies has made the crate nearly unusable when used in conjunction with the majority of the ecosystem (see https://github.com/svartalf/rust-claim/issues/9), and fixes for this issue have been left unanswered.

As the crate is most commonly used as a `dev-dependency`, most affected crates are using it as a dependency directly.

The last release was in February 2021, almost two years ago.

## Alternative

[`claims`](https://crates.io/crates/claims), a fork of the `claim` crate, is a maintained alternative. Pull requests that were pending for `claim` have been merged into `claims` and new versions have been released accordingly on crates.io.
