# Allows accessing uninitialized memory in `send` and `recv`
The safe function `send` allows users to cast arbitrary types as bytes. If user provides a `struct` type with padding bytes, it could violate the safety guarantee of `func` and expose the uninitialized memory. In the safe function `recv`, `uninit()` is called on `MaybeUninit` before initialization. In this case, uninitialized memory could be exposed to `slice::from_raw_parts_mut()`.
