# Memory leaks on macOS 

There were a number of memory leaks when enumerating serial ports on macOS, particularly when performing the "available_ports" method.

Version 4.2.0 has been yanked. However, previous versions are likely to also contain the memory leak bugs where macOS is supported.

It is recommended to update as soon as possible if serialport-rs is being used on macOS.
