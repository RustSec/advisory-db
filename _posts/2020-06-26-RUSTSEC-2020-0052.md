title:       "RUSTSEC-2020-0052: crossbeam-channel: Undefined Behavior in bounded channel"
description: "The affected version of this crates the bounded channel incorrectly assumes that Vecfromiter has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. Vecfromiter does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the bounded channel reconstructs Vec from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when Vecfromiter has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements."

### Description

The affected version of this crate's the `bounded` channel incorrectly assumes that `Vec::from_iter` has allocated capacity that same as the number of iterator elements. `Vec::from_iter` does not actually guarantee that and may allocate extra memory. The destructor of the `bounded` channel reconstructs `Vec` from the raw pointer based on the incorrect assumes described above. This is unsound and causing deallocation with the incorrect capacity when `Vec::from_iter` has allocated different sizes with the number of iterator elements.
