### Description

Affected versions of `rusb` did not require `UsbContext` to implement `Send`
and `Sync`. However, through `Device` and `DeviceHandle` it is possible to use
`UsbContext`s across threads.

This issue allows non-thread safe `UsbContext` types to be used concurrently
leading to data races and memory corruption.

The issue was fixed by adding `Send` and `Sync` bounds to `UsbContext`.
