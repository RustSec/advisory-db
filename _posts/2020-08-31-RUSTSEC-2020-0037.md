### Description

Unsafe code in `ObjectPool` has time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) bug that
can eventually lead to a memory safety violation. `ObjectPool` and `HandlePool`
implicitly assumes that `HandleLike` trait methods are pure, i.e., they always
return the same value. However, this assumption is unsound since `HandleLike`
is a safe, public trait that allows a custom implementation.
