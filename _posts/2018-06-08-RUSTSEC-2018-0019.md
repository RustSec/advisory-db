### Description

Affected versions contain multiple memory safety issues, such as:

 - Unsoundly coercing immutable references to mutable references
 - Unsoundly extending lifetimes of strings
 - Adding the `Send` marker trait to objects that cannot be safely sent between threads

This may result in a variety of memory corruption scenarios, most likely use-after-free.
 
A signficant refactoring effort has been conducted to resolve these issues.
