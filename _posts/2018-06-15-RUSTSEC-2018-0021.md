### Description

Affected versions contained a pair of use-after-free issues with the objects returned by the `get_format_info` and `get_context` methods of `Stream` objects. These objects were mistakenly being constructed without setting an important flag to prevent destruction of the underlying C objects they reference upon their own destruction.
