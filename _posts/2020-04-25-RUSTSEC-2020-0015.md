### Description

Server or client applications that call the SSL_check_chain() function during or after a TLS 1.3 
handshake may crash due to a NULL pointer dereference as a result of incorrect handling of the 
"signature_algorithms_cert" TLS extension. The crash occurs if an invalid or unrecognised signature 
algorithm is received from the peer. This could be exploited by a malicious peer in a Denial of 
Service attack.
