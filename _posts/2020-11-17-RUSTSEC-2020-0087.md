### Description

Affected versions of this crate unconditionally implemented Sync trait for `TryMutex<T>` type.

This allows users to put non-Send `T` type in `TryMutex` and send it to another thread, which can cause a data race.

The flaw was corrected in the 0.3.0 release by adding `T: Send` bound for the Sync trait implementation.
