### Description

Chunk:

* Array size is not checked when constructed with `unit()` and `pair()`.
* Array size is not checked when constructed with `From<InlineArray<A, T>>`.
* `Clone` and `insert_from` are not panic-safe; A panicking iterator causes memory safety issues with them.

InlineArray:

* Generates unaligned references for types with a large alignment requirement.
