### Description

Affected versions of the crate had a Send/Sync implementation for MappedMutexGuard that only considered variance on T, while MappedMutexGuard dereferenced to U.

This could of led to data races in safe Rust code when a closure used in MutexGuard::map() returns U that is unrelated to T.

The issue was fixed by fixing `Send` and `Sync` implementations, and by adding a `PhantomData<&'a mut U>` marker to the `MappedMutexGuard` type to tell the compiler that the guard is over
U too.
