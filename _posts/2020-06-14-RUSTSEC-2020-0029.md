### Description

Affected versions of rgb crate allow viewing and modifying data of any type `T` wrapped in `RGB<T>` as bytes,
and do not correctly constrain `RGB<T>` and other wrapper structures to the types for which it is safe to do so.

Safety violation possible for a type wrapped in `RGB<T>` and similar wrapper structures:

 * If `T` contains padding, viewing it as bytes may lead to exposure of contents of uninitialized memory.
 * If `T` contains a pointer, modifying it as bytes may lead to dereferencing of arbitrary pointers.
 * Any safety and/or validity invariants for `T` may be violated.
 
The issue was resolved by requiring all types wrapped in structures provided by RGB crate to implement an unsafe marker trait.
