### Description

`arr` crate contains multiple security issues. Specifically,

1. It incorrectly implements Sync/Send bounds, which allows to smuggle non-Sync/Send types across the thread boundary.
2. `Index` and `IndexMut` implementation does not check the array bound.
3. `Array::new_from_template()` drops uninitialized memory.
