### Description

## Impact

Unix-like operating systems may segfault due to dereferencing a dangling pointer in specific circumstances. This requires the user to set any environment variable in a different thread than the affected functions.

The affected functions are:

- `time::UtcOffset::local_offset_at`
- `time::UtcOffset::try_local_offset_at`
- `time::UtcOffset::current_local_offset`
- `time::UtcOffset::try_current_local_offset`
- `time::OffsetDateTime::now_local`
- `time::OffsetDateTime::try_now_local`

Non-Unix targets are unaffected. This includes Windows and wasm.

## Patches

Pending a proper fix, the internal method that determines the local offset has been modified to always return `None` on the affected operating systems. This has the effect of returning an `Err` on the `try_*` methods and `UTC` on the non-`try_*` methods.

Users and library authors with time in their dependency tree should perform `cargo update`, which will pull in a the updated, unaffected code.

## Workarounds

No workarounds are known.
